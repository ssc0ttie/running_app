### 🏁 Congrats Transition Week 3! 🎉  
Proud of y'all for being consistent!  
Go rest today — *taas paa!!* hahahaha 🦶😌  
If you feel good, yoga or swim 30min bukas.

---

**@TheR.iZa** – Pwede mo na bilisan ng konti, mukhang chill ka masyado 😅  
Try mo target pace na mas nakaka-challenge sayo.  
Effort level **3–5** (HR **135–145**) for easy runs,  
tapos **Tuesday tempo effort 7–8** (HR **151–165**).

---

**@Fraulein Elaine Camba** – Nasan na relo mo? 😂 Di ko mabasa HR mo.  
Pace mo **goods na**. Focus mo ngayon is to **run non-stop — no walks** kung kaya.  
Wag mo habulin si Aiza, **easy run dapat nakakakanta ka!** 🎤

---

**@Chona Lyn Cuti SG** – *ang ganda mo*, este ng progress mo! 😄  
Keep going.  
Target natin babaan pa HR mo to **140–145**,  
effort level mga **5–6** lang. Kayang kaya yan.

---

**@Lead 🐧** – HR mo sakto na yan sa range to challenge you.  
Pero goal mo is **ibaba pa effort mo**,  
tipong kaya mo mag easy run araw-araw without overfatigue.  
**Stay steady lang, huwag magmadali.**

---

**@Maxine Meneses** – For now, **wag ka muna mag-tempo**.  
Easy runs lang **3x a week** to let your body adapt.  
**Chill ka lang muna** — mahaba pa transition natin, abot pa yan! 💪

---

**Laban lang team!**  
Rest today, **recover hard**, then grind ulit next week! 🔥

            Congrats sa progress natin!  
            Same goals pa rin this week:  
            ✅ Keep the **easy runs easy**  
            ✅ Stay **consistent**  
            ✅ **Trust the process**

            ### 📝 **Individual Notes**

            **@Lead 🐧** & **@Maxine Meneses**  
            - Good job staying **consistent**!  
            - Napapansin ko rin gumaganda na ang **heart rate vs effort** levels — nice one!  
            - Reminder lang: *dahan-dahan* sa pagtaas ng weekly mileage or time on feet.  
            - Biglang ramp-up = risky for **overuse injuries**

            **@TheR.iZa**  
            - Take your time getting back into it  
            - *One week of rest won't erase your fitness*, promise!  
            - Mas risky kung pilitin agad habulin ang mileage  
            - Remember: **Adaptation takes time**

            ---

            ### 🧠 **Quick Science Reminder**
            - **Cardio & Muscles**: adapt fast (~2 weeks)  
            - **Tendons, Ligaments, Bones**: adapt slower (~4+ weeks)  
            - Kaya kahit feeling mo malakas ka na, *extra careful tayo parin*

            💥 **Once pain lingers, it’s usually too late.**  
            Goal natin: not just be fit — but to **stay healthy** too.

            👑 **Recovery is still king.**  
            *Adaptation happens when you rest.*

            ---

            Keep grinding 💪

            Grabe, **5 weeks na** natin ‘to ginagawa!  
            Kaya pa ba? Hahaha! 😂

            At this stage, *may mga masakit na siguro dyan*, so:
            - Be **religious** in logging your runs *and notes*
            - Super helpful 'yan when you start tweaking training or if pain shows up
            - You can even start **experimenting** with weekly goals (e.g., kami ni Chona — *cadence focus*)

            ✅ **Start adding strength training!** Kahit bodyweight lang — okay na okay na.

            - Bawi lang this week!  
            - Try runs that feel almost *boring* — super controlled effort  
            - Don’t worry, the speed will come 💨

            **@Fraulein Elaine Camba**  
            - Walanjo HR mo galit na galit 🤣  
            - Kumalma ka!  
            - Add a longer warm-up — kahit bodyweight squats or jumping jacks before you run. *Gisingin ang katawan!*

            **@Maxine Meneses & @Lead 🐧**  
            - Solid consistency — love it! 🔥  
            - Ignore pace for now — give it 1 more month  
            - Your pace will naturally get faster at the same effort.  
            - That’s the magic of *aerobic base training* 💪

            **@Maxine Meneses**  
            - Reminder: Watch your **recovery**  
            - If you're running over 5 hours/week, make sure to balance it — good thing may yoga ka! Perfect combo 🧘‍♀️

            **@TheR.iZa**  
            - Easy runs look great!  
            - If you want to pick up the pace a bit, go ahead — just stay within **HR 130–145**  
            - Don’t go beyond what’s in the program for now

            **@Chona Lyn Cuti SG**  
            - Grabe mileage mo 😂  
            - Pull back a little — especially on LSDs, slow it down  
            - You’re spending too much time in Zone 3–4. Try **8:30/km pace**  
            - Tempo runs: go for Zone 4–5, your body can handle it!

            **@Fraulein Elaine Camba**  
            - Prioritize **sleep and rest** — your body is waving a white flag 😅  
            - Even your walks are in Zone 3 — time to recover  
            - Adjust your HR target: aim for **145–150**, then work down to **135–145** gradually  
            - You got this — keep at it!

            **@Lead 🐧**  
            - Zone 2 runs looking clean! **HR ~140** is right on point  
            - Stay there for 2 more weeks  
            - We’ll add a little spice to your LSD after that  
            - Keep your easy runs chill

            **@Maxine Meneses**  
            - Your LSD is *a little too long* 😅  
            - Try this structure next time:  
                👉 4km Zone 2  
                👉 1km Zone 3 tempo  
                👉 4km Zone 2  
                👉 1km Zone 3 tempo  
            - That’ll keep you sane 😄  
            - You’ve mastered Zone 2 — great job!  
            - But for **easy runs**, stay chill in **Zone 1–2**

            Track your **protein intake** — it fuels recovery and helps you bounce back stronger.

            - Trust your pace if you can sustain it

            **Congrats on pushing through Transition Week 8!**  
            This week is a **pull-back week** — LSD is just **12km** to allow for recovery and a mental reset.

            Our goal for the final weeks of transition is to **build your baseline fitness**.  
            Before we begin the 18-week marathon program, we’ll **calibrate your individual training plans**:
            - 🎯 Marathon Goal
            - ❤️ Max Heart Rate
            - 🏃‍♀️ Tempo Pace
            - 🐢 Easy Pace
            - 🏁 Marathon Pace

            ⚠️ **Don’t increase pace or intensity** until after Week 12. Stick with your current training rhythm. *Trust the process.*

            ## ⚕️ About Injuries

            Feeling discomfort or fatigue? That’s **normal** — mahirap talaga ‘tong pinasok natin!  
            Most of the time, all you need is:
            - A good night's sleep
            - Proper warm-up
            - Flexibility drills

            💥 **DO NOT RUN IF:**
            1. You feel sharp, stabbing pain  
            2. The pain worsens as you run  
            3. You're changing your form just to keep running  

            📓 This journey is also about **knowing your body**. Stay mindful, log your workouts, and be patient.  
            **We will get there.**

            Wala ka log ng LSD mo? 😅 Don’t be afraid of a little pain — *the body is resilient*.  
            I also run with pain all the time.  
            📝 **Assignment**: Determine your **max HR**.  
            Don’t panic if your HR hits **180+** — it’s usually safe. **Stop** if:
            - You feel like collapsing  
            - You've rested for 5+ mins and your HR is still 180+

            ---

            **@Chona**  
            Stay patient and consistent. We’re still aiming to lower your HR.  
            You probably already know your **optimal pace** — just keep working from there.

            ---

            **@Frau**  
            Monitor your **fatigue and stress levels** — baka ito yung reason for your elevated HR.

        ### 🏃‍♀️ Aiza  
        Ang bilis ng respond ng fitness level mo! Yung **tempo runs mo almost easy run mo na** — kaya mo pa dagdagan yan. Else, just consider it as easy run.  
        We are already seeing the **rewards of smart and consistent training**.  
        As long as you keep it at **80% easy, 20% fast** (yung maayos na tempo ah).

        🔁 Also, can you double-check yung **cadence mo?** Parang sobra taas sa 179?

        📌 **Starting this week, you have to do strength training twice a week** — sorry pahirapan pa kita.  
        We need to give attention to your **structural adaptation**, masyado mabilis adaptation ng aerobic fitness mo — which is a good thing!

        ---

        ### 🧑‍💼 Lead  
        Good job sa **cadence mo** — nakikita na na tumataas na sya.  
        Pati mga **tempo mo bumibilis na rin** while maintaining the same effort level at HR.

        🧠 Monitor mo yung **recovery mo sa tempo runs**, kasi kung pumapalo ka ng **169 HR**, threshold runs na yan.  
        🎯 I-shoot mo lang sa **155–160 bpm** yang tempo pace mo.

        📅 Then you can **alternate weekly** yung threshold run (169+ HR), basta check mo lang recovery mo, kung saan ka mas okay.

        ---

        ### 🧘‍♀️ Maxine  
        Pag feeling mo ready ka na, **bilisan mo pa konti** yung tempo mo.

        ✅ **Perfection na yang easy runs mo**, pace is steadily increasing — **wag mo muna baguhin**. Balikan natin sa Week 12.

        🏃‍♀️ Sa **LSD mo very good na — enjoy mo na!**  
        So pwede mo dagdagan konti kahit **140+ bpm**, Zone 2 pa din yan, para **di ka mabore**.  
        Mukhang ready ka naman na — which is I think ginagawa mo na rin.

        ---

        ### 🧕 Chona  
        Pababa yung **cadence mo**, saka na natin balikan yang tempo runs mo.  
        Baguhin natin approach sayo — **don’t look at HR numbers too much muna** (pero wag lalagpas 170+).

        🎯 Let’s go for **Perceived Effort (RPE) 3–4**:  
        > “Easy but not trivial”  
        > “Can speak in full sentences”

        Then **hold that effort**, we need to see data.

        ### 👩 Frau  
        Di pa din ako masaya dyan sa **HR mo**.  
        Bumibilis yung pace mo — **wala muna tempo run for you**, para wala ka muna masyado iniisip.

        🚫 Kahit wag mo na muna ibigay yung **max HR mo** — mukhang di ka pa ready.  
        ✅ **Kunin mo muna yung confidence mo sa easy runs** mo.

        Ang gulo din ng **pace, cadence at RPE mo eh**, wala akong makitang trend sayo hahahaha 😅  
        Or magulo kayo mag-log ng runs — tinatawag nyong tempo yung mga easy runs nyo hahaha.

        📌 Same kayo ni Chona:  
        As long as you can speak, effort level 3–4 yan — **gamitin natin na baseline** nyo.

        Pero ayun nga — **easy runs ka muna okay?**  
        **Keep it up — I'm proud of you!** 🫶
